# Align Items on Center with Snake Animation and Streak

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to center-align items on the page while incorporating a snake animation and streak effect. The snake animation is a fun and interactive way to showcase how CSS animations can be used to create dynamic and engaging user experiences. This project can be used as a starting point for more complex animations or layout designs.

## Features
- **Centered Items**: The items are perfectly aligned in the center of the page using modern CSS techniques.
- **Snake Animation**: A playful snake animation is applied to the elements, creating a moving effect.
- **Streak Effect**: A streak animation adds an extra flair, making the page more visually dynamic.

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the project.

## How It Works
1. **Centering Items**: Flexbox is used to center the items both horizontally and vertically within the page.
2. **Snake Animation**: CSS `@keyframes` is used to animate the movement of elements, giving the appearance of a snake-like effect.
3. **Streak Effect**: The streak is created using CSS animation, adding an exciting visual effect to the project.
